- [To Do App](https://github.com/ericlemiere/javascript-projects/tree/main/ToDo_app)
- [Weather App](https://github.com/ericlemiere/javascript-projects/tree/main/weather_app)


### Pizza Menu:
This is a mock Pizza menu where the user can order a pizza and customize its toppings, and the site adds up the total and shows the receipt based on toppings added.

### Tic Tac Toe:
A classic tic tac toe game when you play against the computer. 

### Calculator:
A basic, 4-functin calculator app with a classic look and feel. 

### ToDo App:
A basic ToDo app.

### Weather App:
This app calls an API from a weather site and receives JSON data to parse through. The data is limited, due to it being a free account, so the app is also limited and has its shortcomings.
