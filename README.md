These are some projects I created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Projects:

- [Calculator](https://github.com/ericlemiere/javascript-projects/tree/main/Calculator)


### Pizza Menu:
This is a mock Pizza menu where the user can order a pizza and customize its toppings, and the site adds up the total and shows the receipt based on toppings added.

### Tic Tac Toe:
A classic tic tac toe game when you play against the computer. 

### Calculator:
A basic, classic calculator app.
